Space Mission Data Analysis ðŸš€
This project is a data analysis and visualization script built with Python. It explores a rich dataset of all space missions from the beginning of the Space Race in 1957 to the present. The script cleans the raw data and generates a series of interactive plots to turn data into actionable insights about space exploration trends.

Analysis & Visualizations
The script performs a series of analyses and creates visualizations to answer key questions, including:

Launch Frequency: A line chart showing the total number of space launches per year.

Top Organizations: A line chart that tracks the launch activity of the top organizations over time, identifying historical and modern leaders.

Mission Cost: A line chart that visualizes the average cost of a space mission over time.

Seasonal Trends: A bar chart illustrating the most popular months for space launches.

Mission Success Rate: A line chart showing the mission success rate as a percentage over time, highlighting improvements in technology and safety.

Global Activity: A choropleth map (a world map) showing the total number of launches originating from each country.

Technologies Used
The following libraries were used in this project:

Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

Plotly: For creating interactive and publication-quality data visualizations.

How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository or Download Files:
Make sure you have the Python script and the mission_launches.csv file in the same directory.

Install Dependencies:
You need to install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. You can do this with a single command in your terminal.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Script:
Execute the Python script from your terminal.

python your_script_name.py

This will run the analysis, print key insights to the console, and open a series of interactive plots in your web browser.
